Description: It can be useful to temporarily hide some text or other HTML elements 
    in 'Shiny' applications. Building on 'Spoiler-Alert.js', it is possible to select the
    elements to hide at startup, to partially reveal them by hovering them, and to 
    completely show them when clicking on them.
